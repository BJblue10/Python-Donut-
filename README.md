# Python-Donut-
This is a program that makes a Python Donut with the ascii method. 

# Why did I Program in this Way #

I based my code on a Reddit programmer who used the 'ASCII method' to create a 3D program that simulates a donut. I wanted to recreate this code to push the limits of Python and improve my programming skills. It took me about an hour to learn and code, and though it was difficult, I had a lot of support from Google and YouTube.
